# Primes

R scripts for plotting numbers as prime factor products. 
By convention 1 is not prime. 
Every number is the product of a unique series of prime factors. 
Currently implemented as deriving from a manually entered factor table.
Scripts included for:

 * creating a series of empty shapes for colouring or cutting
 * creating coloured shapes for printing
